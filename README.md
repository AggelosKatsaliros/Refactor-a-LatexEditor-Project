# Refactor-a-LatexEditor-Project
This is a refactored LatexEditor project by using mutiple refactoring algorithms.
It follows mvc design pattern.
I dealt with problems like duplicate code ,long methods,dead code and classes-methods that are in view package and contains application logic by using substistute algorithm,Extract Super Class , Remove Middle Man refactoring, Move Method and the Move Field refactorings  .

Finally I implemented two tasks following the command pattern .
